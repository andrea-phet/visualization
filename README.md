A 300 dimensional array looks like [0.9, 0.7, 0.24, …, 0.1] and I want to project that down to two dimensions: [0.6, 0.7].

As for how much it likes those answers, I think that the percentage would do well. And I would make categories of percentages that determine shading.

I’m assuming all guesses are in the same dimensional space. Like they all hav ethe same number of dimensions.
