visualization
============

### File input format

For the question text, I would use one file containing the full question text, and then the file_input_format.csv indicates the index of the word.

For showing how much the algorithm likes the answers, I would use the probability. And I would make categories of percentages to determine shading.

Iâ€™m assuming all guesses are in the same dimensional space, i.e. they all have the same number of dimensions.

A 300 dimensional array looks like ( a_1, a_2, ... , a_300 ) and I want to project that down to two dimensions, ( x, y ) to visualize.
